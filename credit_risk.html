    <h1>Loan Default Prediction — Credit Risk Modeling</h1>
    <p class="case-lead">Lending Club loan status prediction with ML models</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project uses a real-world Lending Club loan dataset to build a model that predicts
            whether a loan will be fully paid or defaulted. The workflow combines data analysis,
            feature engineering and model experimentation to obtain a reliable credit risk signal.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Analysis &amp; Feature Engineering</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Inspected missing values and applied selective imputation or removal</li>
            <li>Identified highly correlated features and reduced multicollinearity</li>
            <li>Dropped high-cardinality features with low predictive value</li>
            <li>Converted <code>loan_status</code> into a binary target (Fully Paid vs. Charged Off)</li>
            <li>Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features for model compatibility</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Class Imbalance Handling</h2>
        <p>
            The target distribution is imbalanced: “Fully Paid” loans are much more frequent than
            “Charged Off”. Because of this, simple accuracy would be misleading, so the evaluation
            focuses on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Precision</li>
            <li>Recall</li>
            <li>F1-score</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This helps to better understand how well the model identifies truly risky loans
            instead of just predicting the majority class.
        </p>

        <h2>Models Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Random Forest</li>
            <li>Neural Network (Keras / TensorFlow)</li>
            <li>XGBoost</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Different models were trained and compared. XGBoost showed strong performance on
            non-linear relationships and sparse features, while Random Forest and the neural
            network provided useful baselines for benchmarking.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Key Insights &amp; Outcomes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Loan grade (especially lower grades such as F and G) is a strong predictor of default risk.</li>
            <li>The strong correlation between loan amount and installment guided feature selection.</li>
            <li>Cleaning, encoding and targeted feature engineering had a clear impact on model quality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The final setup provides a practical foundation for a credit risk scoring pipeline
            that can be adapted to fintech or lending products.
