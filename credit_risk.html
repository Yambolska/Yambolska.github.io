    <<h1>Credit Risk & Loan Default Modeling — Lending Club Dataset</h1>
<p class="article-lead">A data-driven financial risk modeling case using real loan applicants.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project uses real Lending Club loan data to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan will be fully paid or defaulted. The analysis focuses on how borrower characteristics, credit history and financial indicators correlate with repayment risk, and how clean feature engineering and model selection can improve predictive performance.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Data Preparation & Feature Engineering</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Missing values analyzed and imputed or strategically dropped</li>
        <li>High-cardinality and redundant categorical features removed</li>
        <li>Created a binary target <code>loan_paid</code> from <code>loan_status</code></li>
        <li>One-hot encoded categorical variables</li>
        <li>Identified correlated features and reduced multicollinearity</li>
        <li>Adjusted for class imbalance and focused on precision/recall and F1-score metrics</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Exploratory Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Loan grade strongly correlates with default likelihood</li>
        <li>Lower grades (F and G) show extremely high default ratios</li>
        <li>Loan amount and installment are nearly perfectly correlated</li>
        <li>Most features provide independent predictive signals</li>
        <li>Employment length and job title showed weak predictive power and were dropped</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Imbalance & Evaluation Approach</h2>
    <p>
        Because “Fully Paid” loans significantly outnumber “Charged Off” loans, accuracy alone would be misleading. Therefore evaluation emphasized:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recall for identifying defaults</li>
        <li>Precision of default predictions</li>
        <li>F1-score as the balanced measure</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Models Used</h2>
    <p>Several machine learning models were implemented and compared:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Random Forest — AUC: 0.89</li>
        <li>Keras Neural Network — AUC: 0.90</li>
        <li>XGBoost — AUC: 0.91</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All models demonstrated strong predictive capability with XGBoost performing the best overall, consistent with its strength on tabular datasets. Tree-based models also allow for feature importance analysis, improving interpretability for financial risk teams.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Interpretation & Business Meaning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All tested models effectively differentiate between fully-paid and charged-off loans</li>
        <li>XGBoost is slightly superior and the most reliable model for production use</li>
        <li>Tree-based models are highly interpretable for financial decision-support systems</li>
        <li>Deep learning performs well, but does not significantly outperform boosted trees in this context</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion & Potential Applications</h2>
    <p>
        This project shows how real consumer loan application data can be transformed into actionable default-risk predictions using structured feature engineering and machine learning. XGBoost offers the best balance of performance and interpretability, making it suitable for credit scoring applications. With further tuning and potential ensembling, the predictive framework could support underwriting decisions, reduce default exposure, and strengthen credit portfolio risk management.
