    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I’m driven by curiosity about how data reflects real human behavior.
        I get excited by the relationship between numbers and real-world actions —
        the idea that behind every metric, there is a decision, a habit, a motivation.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ve learned that data doesn’t always tell the full story: patterns can
        highlight what is happening, but truly understanding why often requires
        looking beyond the dataset and into real life context.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m particularly interested in working on anything that improves user
        experience — understanding how users interact with products, where they
        struggle, how they engage, and how products can better serve them.
