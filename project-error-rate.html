    <h1>Error Rate Impact on Gameplay &amp; Engagement</h1>
    <p class="project-tag">Case Study · Game Analytics · User Experience</p>

    <p>
        This case study examines how in-game error frequency shapes player behavior and engagement.
        Users are segmented into error buckets (low, mid, high, extreme), and their gameplay metrics
        such as days played, sessions per day, play intensity, matches per session, win rate and
        completion rate are compared across segments.
    </p>

    <p>
        The analysis shows that as error frequency increases, players demonstrate lower play intensity,
        reduced engagement and worse performance. In a mid-core mobile FPS environment, where
        in-app purchases generate roughly ten times more revenue than advertising, this loss of engagement
        directly limits monetization potential.

    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When analyzing error rates by country, platform and gameplay impact, error frequency plays a major role in shaping user experience.</li>
        <li>In a mid-core mobile FPS game, errors reduce player satisfaction and prevent sustained engagement and attachment to the game.</li>
        <li>Since revenue from in-game purchases is roughly 10x higher than ad-based revenue, gameplay-disrupting errors directly reduce the potential for in-game spending.</li>
        <li>Higher error rates negatively affect user retention, gameplay satisfaction and ultimately company revenue.</li>
    </ul>
