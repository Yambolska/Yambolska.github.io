    <h1>Why Data Alone Is Not Enough — Context Matters</h1>
    <p class="article-lead">NUMBERS SHOW WHAT HAPPENS — CONTEXT EXPLAINS WHY.</p>

    <section>
        <p>
            In data analysis, there is often an unspoken assumption that numbers are objective and
            decisive — that if you measure something precisely enough, the truth will reveal
            itself. But in real-world systems, metrics show <strong>what happened</strong> —
            not <strong>why it happened</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As analysts, our job is not only to calculate metrics, but to connect them with
            human behavior, domain realities and context. Otherwise, the story we tell with data
            can be technically correct and practically wrong.

        <h2>E-commerce example</h2>
        <p><strong>Data:</strong><br>
           Cart abandonment rate increased from 64% to 79%.
        </p>
        <p><strong>If you only look at data, you might think:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pricing is too high</li>
            <li>Users are indecisive</li>
            <li>Competition became stronger</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>But when you add context:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A shipping provider updated their API → checkout started failing on mobile</li>
            <li>A new CAPTCHA slowed down the last step</li>
            <li>Payment friction increased in some countries</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Numbers alone only show abandonment. Context reveals the
            <strong>user frustration</strong> behind it.
        </p>

        <h2>Banking &amp; Finance example</h2>
        <p><strong>Data:</strong><br>
           Transaction volume drops every month on day 28.
        </p>
        <p><strong>On a pure numerical view:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users are less active</li>
            <li>Loyalty is declining</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>But context reveals:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Day 28 is when salaries run out in several markets → cash liquidity drops →
                spending volume goes down.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Same data, different interpretation — the correct conclusion only comes with
            real-world context.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Supply chain example</h2>
        <p><strong>Data:</strong><br>
           Delivery delays increased by 23%.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Interpretation without context:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Warehouse is inefficient</li>
            <li>Logistics team is slow</li>
            <li>Inventory is mismanaged</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Context reveals:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extreme weather disrupted two distribution regions</li>
            <li>A port strike paused inbound freight</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            No amount of SQL or clustering would give you that insight by itself — you need
            operational knowledge and external information.
        </p>

        <h2>Healthcare example</h2>
        <p><strong>Data:</strong><br>
           Patient no-show rate increased for medical appointments.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Raw conclusion:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Patients are unreliable</li>
            <li>Appointment reminders are ineffective</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Contextual reality:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>A bus route change made it physically harder to reach the clinic</li>
            <li>Scheduling overlapped with working hours for lower-income patients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Numbers suggest behavior. Context reveals <strong>accessibility and social
            constraints</strong>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Food &amp; Consumption example</h2>
        <p><strong>Data:</strong><br>
           Demand for a product spikes in specific months.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Without context:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maybe because of marketing</li>
            <li>Maybe just random volatility</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seasonal consumption patterns (e.g. ice cream in summer)</li>
            <li>Cultural holidays (e.g. certain foods during Ramadan, Thanksgiving, Lunar New Year)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Numbers alone cannot capture <strong>social meaning</strong>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>In gaming</h2>
        <p>
            Gameplay analytics also benefit from context. Data alone might show:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Error exposure</li>
            <li>Win rate</li>
            <li>Retention</li>
            <li>Monetization</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            But context explains things like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frustration thresholds</li>
            <li>Psychological investment</li>
            <li>Device quality differences</li>
            <li>Network conditions</li>
            <li>Cultural playstyles</li>
            <li>Social and competitive motivations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For example: a user with many sessions and many errors does not mean errors
            increase engagement. It may simply mean a highly engaged player has
            <strong>more opportunities</strong> to encounter bugs.
        </p>

        <h2>The real job of a data analyst</h2>
        <p>
            Good analytics is not only:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>SQL queries</li>
            <li>Dashboards</li>
            <li>Percentiles</li>
            <li>Clustering</li>
            <li>Metrics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Real analytics is combining data with <strong>domain knowledge</strong>,
            <strong>UX understanding</strong> and <strong>human context</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In every field — e-commerce, banking, gaming, healthcare, logistics — the pattern
            is the same:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data gives us signal.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Context gives us meaning.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Data without context leads to wrong conclusions.<br>
            Context without data leads to intuition-based guessing.<br>
            <strong>True insight requires both.</strong>
        </p>
    </section>

            I’m always open to exchanging ideas about data, metrics and how they connect
            back to real human behavior.
